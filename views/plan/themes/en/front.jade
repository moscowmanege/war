	p The battle of Moscow incorporating a variegated complex of different operations, battles and combats was developing over a huge territory and continued nonstop during 203 days and nights. Unsuccessful course of military actions at the fronts during the first days of the war resulted in the loss of huge territories with their corresponding material and human resources. Prior to war, the territory of the Soviet Union temporarily captured by the enemy mined 63% of coal, yielded 68% of cast iron, 58% of steel, produced 68% of aluminum, yielded 38% of grain crops and 84% of sugar. Great were the losses of army personnel, armaments and warfare. Out of 303 divisions available to our army prior to war, 237 were engaged in the forefront actions and suffered huge losses.
	p Seizure of Moscow as the decisive victory over the USSR was planned for the summer-autumn campaign of 1941. Nevertheless, the thoroughly developed «Barbarossa» plan started failing. Dogged resistance of Soviet troops in the Smolensk battle (10.7-10.9.1941) thwarted the attempt of Hitler’s forces to smoothly enter Moscow. In the course of this battle the formations of the Red Army inflicted extremely sensitive damage to the German “Center” Army Group by brave counterblows forcing them to stop while they were only 350-375 km away from Moscow (within a reach of two-three days for German tanks). The German troops were bogged down for almost two months in the defense of the Western, Central and Bryansk fronts. The tasks set out in this plan “to destroy Soviet Russia within a short-term campaign” were not achieved within the planned time.
	p The enemy required new decisions, additional forces and means. Directive No. 35 signed by A. Hitler on September 6, 1941 stated that there were created all necessary prerequisites for a decisive operation in the East and attack on Moscow. Never before the German high command concentrated such powerful forces in one strategic direction. The developed plan of a decisive assault on Moscow was issued on September 16 and received a code name «Typhoon». The attack order to the “Center” Army Group was given 10 days later, on September 26. Fast build-up of fighting strength of the “Center” Army Group aiming at Moscow did represent a real quickly growing threat to the city and to the country as a whole. The Soviet command, in turn, concentrated its main efforts in the Western strategic direction by trying to prevent enemy troops from Moscow. In the defensive battles on the lines distant from Moscow some 280-350 km, it was planned to tire out the striking enemy grouping by stubborn defense, to stabilize the front, gain time required to accumulate the means and forces, and transfer to a decisive counterattack by destroying the “Center” Army Group. By the end of September the composition of troops of the Western, Bryansk and Reserve fronts acting in the Western direction was strengthened by more than 40% in personnel and artillery, 35% in tanks and one third of airplanes available at that time at the Soviet-German front.
	p In the regions of Vyazma and Bryansk the Soviet troops suffered a rigorous defeat by losing 1 million people. As a result of the fronts location covering Moscow from the West a gap was formed with extension of about 500 km which was quickly used by the German command. The advance Wehrmacht formations reached the Mozhaisk defense line in certain directions already by October 10. Soon fierce fighting started on the historic Borodino field at a distance of 100-110 km from the capital. The stubbornness of the Red Army soldiers at the Mozhaisk defense line forced the German command to stop the attack on Moscow. By the end of October the Wehrmacht attack was stopped. The grouping of German troops attacking the capital lost its penetrative power. Refreshment with new reserves, armaments, rations, clothing and ammunition were required. Starting the second “general” assault on Moscow on November 15, the German troops after 15-18 days of fierce fighting advanced to 50-80 km more, but in the area of Krasnaya Polyana they were definitely stopped by the Red Army at a distance of only 30 kilometers from the Kremlin. At this line the attacking strength of the enemy died out…
	p The Soviet command prepared a counterattack within a short time and the counteroffensive operation was launched on December 5, 1941 and continued till the 7th of January 1942. In the course of counterattack our troops threw the enemy to a range of 100-250 km from the capital removing the threat to the Moscow industrial region. This is exactly in the vicinity of Moscow when the German army tasted the bitterness of defeat first time since 1939. The main thing, it lost the «lightning» war against the USSR. Starting from January 8, in accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief I.V. Stalin the troops of the Red Army switched to the general attack; the final stage of the battle of Moscow was on to continue till the 20th of April. The wreck of the “Blitzkrieg” strategy made Germany to face a perspective of a prolonged and dragged-out war.
