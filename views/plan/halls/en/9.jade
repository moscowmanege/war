	div: i “When I said that I was enlisting as a volunteer my three dearest people took my decision for granted. None of them tried to talk me out: neither papa, nor mama nor Lyolya”
	p: i From memoirs of MSU student V. Dunayevsky, 2 July 1941

	p Moscow Military District War Council adopted resolution "On enlistment in volunteer corps". Those were formed under the auspices of: Lieutenant General Artemiev (Chairman), Sokolov (Communist Party leader), Yakovlev (Communist Party leader), Pegov (Communist Party leader), Filippov (Foodstuffs Department chief), Brigade Commander Onuprienko and lieutenant colonel Prostov. Mobilization tasks were vested in extraordinary “troikas” (committees of three) headed by Communist Party secretaries. They also included district military commissars and chiefs of district NKVD departments. Enlisted men, 50% platoon commanders, up to 40 % company commanders, medical and political personnel were to be staffed by workers. The rest of command – by Moscow Military District cadres. The District Headquarters supplied the volunteer corps with arms and ammunition, while transport, tools and equipment were provided from the resources of Moscow, Moscow region and districts. The enlisted personnel received salary of their recent place of employment. Enterprises, institutions and educational institutions of Moscow and Moscow region called meetings with a call to join volunteer corps. Massive enlistment began. That day in Frunzensky district over 4500 applications were filed, in Leninsky – 3800, in Tagansky – 2700.
	p On 4 July 1941 the State Defense Committee adopted resolution “On voluntary mobilization of Moscow and Moscow region workers to volunteer divisions”. It provided for creation of 12 divisions by July 7. In accordance with the resolution of the Moscow Communist Party Committee of 27 June 1941 by July 1 Moscow formed 25 mopping-up battalions (Moscow region – 62) with the total strength of 28.5 thousand persons to counteract subversive activities, keep public order and secure critical facilities. During the period of operation they stopped 3557 poachers including 250 spies. During the period of Moscow defense some of mopping-up battalions were transformed into partisan detachments, 23 capital battalions and 10 regional battalions formed 4-th and 5-th rifle divisions.
	p The critical situation that developed in the first half of October as a result of partial penetration by the enemy of the Mozhaysk line of defense posed a serious threat to Moscow. In the morning of October 13 activists of Moscow Communist party organization called a meeting addressed by Moscow Party Secretary Shcherbakov. On the same day district party committees and primary organizations launched an effort to form communist battalions, select commanders and political instructors, identify arms, clothing and food resources. On October 14 Moscow Defense Area Commander Lieutenant General Artemiev, Military Council Member Shcherbakov and Moscow Military District Chief of Staff Major General Kudryashov issued an order to the Moscow Garrison to set, in particular, an objective to integrate party and young communist battalions in the capital defense system. The Moscow City Council was instructed to second some of them to the command of the chief of the Moscow defense line.
	p On October 16 formation of communist battalions in Moscow was generally completed. The battalions numbered about 10 thousand men. That was a manifestation of powerful patriotic drive of all segments of Moscow population.
