	div: i “…Right in front of our car several fire bombs fell. The bombs were immediately put out by dwellers of close-by houses. Especially ardent were 14-15 year-old teens who were just hunting bombs and shouting “Mine, mine” rushed to a flaring bomb”
	p: i From memoirs of Local Air Defense Chief of Staff S. Lapirov

	p While the mission of Moscow Air Defense was to keep enemy aircraft off the city the local air defense system (LAD) served the objectives of public security, rescue and enemy bombardment consequence management in the capital itself, fail-proof operation of enterprises and institutions, provision of livelihood of urban economy.
	p On 22 June 1941 following the statement of the Soviet Government on the treacherous attack of Nazi military forces on the USSR the Moscow City Radio Network broadcast Order 1 of LAD Chief Brigade Commander S. Frolov and Chief of LAD Staff Major S.Lapirov for Moscow and Moscow Region. In accordance with the order, due to the threat of air attack on the city from 01.00 p.m. on June 22 the capital and the region were proclaimed in a threat situation, blackout regime was introduced and the entire LAD system was put on full combat alert. And on 5 July by the Resolution of the State Defense Committee of the USSR “On reorganization of Moscow LAD service” the entire personnel were confined to barracks.
	p There was not a single enterprise, institution, educational institution, school or residential house that would not have its air defense squad. House management offices alone operated 3600 self-defense groups with the strength of 81.6 thousand persons. About 13 thousand fire brigades were formed counting 205.2 thousand persons. Local air defense services were transformed into special units. The operations of LAD battalions and regiments in the territory of the city were managed by the capital’s LAD Staff.
	p Nazis planned to destroy Moscow from the air. On the night of July 22, exactly one month after the beginning of the war, the first enemy air raid on the capital took place. Only odd aircraft managed to break through to Moscow to drop fire and demolition bombs. LAD fighters quickly eliminated fires that broke out in several districts. Many years since war-time Moscovites would with sincere gratitude recall Moscow Metro that had delivered many of them of deadly threat and were ready to repeat after a five-year girl: “I love pa, ma and the all-clear signal”.
	p Air alert was announced in Moscow 141 times, the last time on 9 June 1943. 1610 demolition and 150 thousand fire bombs were dropped on the capital, counting out 687 demolition bombs and many thousands of fire bombs dropped on fake targets. About 40 thousand of the dropped fire bombs were liquidated by LAD detachments at the spot, put out were over 3000 serious inflammations, 1541 fires including 675 major ones. During enemy raids 7708 people were injured and 2196 of them died.
