The scope and brilliance of its recent devastating counter-attack, which forced the Germans to retreat from Moscow, became the greatest achievement of the entire history”
	p: i From the telegram of the US General Douglas MacArthur, dated February 23 1942

	p The general situation prevailing on the Soviet-German front at the end of November – beginning of December 1941, was extremely tense. It was the most difficult and critical moment in history of the Great Patriotic War. As a result of war losses and evacuation of the industry gross output of the USSR from June to November went down 2,1 times. Despite difficulties associated with providing our army with weapons and ammunition, the General Headquarters managed to form 9 reserve armies (59 infantry and 13 cavalry divisions), which were deployed on the prepared for the defense rear boundary: Vytegra, Cherepovets, Rybinsk, Yaroslavl, Gorky. Kozmodemyansk, Penza, Balakovo, Saratov, Kamyshin, Stalingrad and Astrakhan. In late November and early December from the internal military districts 43 separate infantry brigades were transferred directly to the Moscow region. In the area of Zagorsk the 1st Attack Army was formed. The Task Force of Major General Lizyukov of the Moscow Defense Zone was reorganized into the 20st Army. From November 24 on the order of the Supreme Command General Headquarters in the rear areas of the Western Front redeployment of three reserve armies (the 10th, 26th and 61st) had begun. The 1st Attack army, the 20th and 10th armies were included into the composition of the Western Front while the 24th and 60th were made part of the Moscow Defense Zone. Thus, at the end of November, when the enemy's reserves were exhausted, the Soviet command had significant forces, not yet committed to battle.
	p In accordance with the current situation, the Military Council of the Western Front (commanded by the Army General G.K. Zhukov) on November 30 submitted at the Supreme Command General Headquarters a plan of counteroffensive. The immediate task of the troops of the Western Front was by "a strike in the direction of Klin – Solnechnogorsk and in the direction of  Istra to crush the main grouping of the enemy on the right wing and by a strike at Uzlovaya and Bogoroditsk from the flank and rear attack against the Guderian Group to defeat the enemy on the left wing of the front». Against the northern attack group of the German forces converging strikes were dealt by the 30 th, 1 st Attack, 20 th and 16 th Armies, and against the south enemy attack group – the strikes were dealt by reinforced 1 st Guards Cavalry Corps and the 10 th Army. In order to immobilize the enemy forces in the rest of the front and deny them a possibility to transfer the troops, the 5, 33, 43, 49 and the 50 th Armies had to go into the offensive. On December 1 the Kalinin Front (commanded by Colonel General I.S. Konev) joined in the counteroffensive. The troops of the Southwestern Front (commanded by Marshal of the Soviet Union S.K. Timoshenko), using its right flank, also took part in the operation. The counteroffensive of the Soviet troops near Moscow was the first major offensive operation of strategic importance, carried out by the efforts of three fronts. The German attack forces suffered a defeat and were driven back 100-250 km to the west of the lines which they held as of December 6. The threat to the capital and the Moscow industrial area was eliminated. The Red Army liberated more than 11 thousand inhabited localities, and reached the line Rzhev – Ruza – Borovsk – Mtsensk. The total losses of the Soviet troops near Moscow amounted to 370 955 people, 429 tanks, 13,350 guns and mortars, 140 combat aircraft.
	p On January 8 without operational rest the Rzhev-Vyazma offensive operation was commenced. Pursuant to the instructions of the Supreme Command, Commander of the Kalinin Front, Colonel General I.S. Konev,  assigned  a task for the 39 th Army– by a strike from the area west of Rzhev to break through the enemy's defenses and developing an offensive in the direction of Sychevka, Vyazma, in coordination with the 30 th Army and the 1st Attack Army of the Western Front to defeat the enemy group which operated here. The task of capturing the city of Rzhev – an important defense center – and destructing enemy forces which acted on the defensive in its area was entrusted to the troops of the 29 th and 31 st armies. The 11 th Cavalry Corps, regrouped in the offensive zone of the 39 th Army, was assigned a task of entering into the breakthrough area and developing the offensive on Vyazma, to cut the highway and railroad between Vyazma and Izdeshkovo. The 22nd Army by an offensive in the general direction towards Beliy, Yartsevo had to cover the troops of the front from possible enemy attacks from the west. The commander of the troops of the Western Front, Army General G.K. Zhukov decided by an offensive of the 1st Attack, 20 th and 16 th Armies from the front-line Lotoshino, Ruza and in the general direction towards Sychevka in cooperation with the troops of the Kalinin Front to defeat the superior enemy group; using the 5th and 33 th armies to attack from the front-line Ruza, Borovsk in the general direction towards Mozhaisk, Gzhatsk and using the armies of the left wing (43, 49 and 50 armies) to deal a strike from the front-line Maloyaroslavets, Kaluga in the general direction towards Yukhnov in order to crush the  enemy group operating here and to further develop the offensive on Vyazma from southeast. The 1 st Guards Cavalry Corps was assigned a task – by bypassing the said enemy grouping from the south, to quickly advance in the area of Vyazma and here link up with the units of the 11 th Cavalry Corps of the Kalinin Front. In the first weeks of the offensive the attack forces achieved significant results. The advance units of the 33 th Army of Lieutenant General M.G. Efremov on February 1st reached the southeastern suburbs of Vyazma and engaged in the combat for the city. However, it failed to capture Vyazma. By the morning of February 2 the units of the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps together with the paratroopers of the 8 th Airborne Brigade came out to the southern approaches to Vyazma and launched an offensive on the city, but had no success. Yet earlier, on January 26, the 11 th Cavalry Corps came to the motorway 12 km west of Vyazma and on the next day cut the highway, but was driven back by the enemy to the north, where it took on the defensive.
	p Over time, the offensive capabilities of the fronts were exhausted and the offensive was suspended. Many areas of the Kalinin, Smolensk and Orel regions were liberated. However, the objectives assigned by the Supreme Command General Headquarters, namely  to crush the Rzhev-Gzhatsk-Vyazma group of the enemy turned to be beyond the strength of the troops of the Western direction due to complete exhaustion of their offensive capabilities. The total losses of the Soviet forces in the Rzhev-Vyazma operation amounted to 776.9 thousand. men. The operation turned to be unfinished. Due to fruitless attempts to break through the defense of the German troops and the ensuing muddy season on April 20, 1942 it was decided to take on the defensive.
