	div: i “In deadly silence the text of Molotov’s speech was read out: “The Soviet Government ordered our forces to rebuff the villain attack…” – this order of the day was perceived as if addressed to every one of us present”
	p: i From memoirs of MSU student G. Karpov

	p With effect from June 23, 1941 the Soviet Union declared general mobilization. During the first three days of war Moscow enterprises sent to the front over 71 thousand men, including more than 62 thousand workers and about 5 thousand engineering staff. District military commissariats and Young Communist League District Committees by that day received 50 thousand applications from young volunteers for forthwith dispatch to the frontline. Within the first 6 war months alone hundreds of thousands of Moscovites left for the front. In July Moscow together with Moscow region formed 12 volunteer divisions, 87 mopping-up battalions, 25 LAD battalions, 169 special armed workers’ detachments of volunteers trained in street fights, as well as 25 anti-tank detachments (one for each district of the capital). Formed in October-November were 3 divisions on the basis of workers’, communist and mopping-up battalions and 1 division of Moscow and Region conscripts, the military of the Moscow Garrison, mopping-up personnel and Moscow volunteers.
	p Moscow and Moscow region sent conscripts and volunteers to man other military formations. Thus, Zhdanovsky and Tagansky district volunteers manned the 282-th rifle division, Pervomaisky district volunteers joined the 269th rifle division. 7 thousand volunteers of Kominternovsky district formed the core of the 305th rifle division. In total during 4 years of the war Moscow dispatched for combatant army about 850 thousand men. Moscow was the focal point for training commander and engineering staff for the army.
	p Moscow workers helped the fighting corps not just with manufacture of required supplies with excess of working standards. At the very start of the war Moscow initiated other forms of support for our fighters: “Blood donation for wounded warriors!”, Defense Fund Raising, contribution of warm clothing for frontline fighters and later – patronage of military units. Such initiatives got support of Moscow research community, artists and other segments of Moscow population.
