	div: i “Spilled blood and sacrifices made by troops of the besieged group were not in vain. The feat of the Soviet soldiers which heroically fought at Vyazma and which made a great contribution to the common cause of defense of Moscow, is still waiting for a proper evaluation”
	p: i From memoirs of commander of the Western Front, G.K. Zhukov.

	p The troops of the three Soviet fronts – the Western, Reserve and Bryansk – occupied defense 300 km to the west of Moscow, in a zone some 800 km wide. This grouping, which covered about one-third of the active part of the Soviet-German front, comprised more than 40% of the Red Army forces acting between the Baltic and the Black Seas.
	p On September 30 began the Orel-Bryansk defense operation (30.09 – 23.10.1941), which was conducted by the troops of the Bryansk Front (commanded by Colonel General A.I. Eremenko). As a result of an extremely unsuccessful start of the operation, his troops by the end of October 6 turned out to be split into three parts. Basic communication lines of the front were intercepted by forces of the 2nd Panzer Army which cut behind the Red Army troops. By October 23 the troops with great losses broke through the encirclement and reached the line Belev, Mtsensk, Ponyri, Fatezh, Lgov. By their fights they bogged an advance of the German troops on Tula for 17 days.
	p On October 2 began Vyazemskaya defensive operation, conducted by the troops of the West front (commanded by Colonel General I.S. Konev) and Reserve front (commanded by Marshal of the Soviet Union S.M. Budyonny) (02.10 – 13.10.41). Against the forces of the 30th Amy (commanded by Major-General V.A. Khomenko) and the 19th Army (commanded by Lieutenant General M.F. Lukin) of the Western Front, which comprised eight infantry divisions, in a 75 km – wide frontal strip the enemy amassed and deployed troops of the 3rd Panzer group (commanded by Colonel-General G. Got) and the main forces of the 9th army (commanded by Colonel-General A. Strauss). In this direction the enemy grouping was superior to Soviet forces: by personnel – 3 times, the tanks – 1,7 times, the guns and mortars – 3.8 times. The second enemy attack group was comprised of 11 infantry, five tank and two motorized divisions. Colonel General I.S. Konev decided, using counterattacks by troops of the 30th and 19th armies and part of his reserves, united into a task force commanded by Lieutenant-General I.V. Boldin, to push back the enemy and restore the situation. However, despite introduction of reserves, counterattacks made on October 3 and 4, were not successful. On October 5, Supreme Command General Headquarters gave a command to the withdrawal of troops to new defensive positions. However, the command was delayed and the troops were unable to retreat in an orderly manner. From October 8, they tried to break through the encirclement. But only separate forces managed to escape, having lost material equipment and heavy armament. Persistent fighting in the area of Vyazma continued until October 13.
	p Under Vyazma and Bryansk 7 of 15 army commands were encircled , 64 divisions of 95, 11 of the 13 armored brigades, 50 of 62 artillery regiments of the High Command Reserve. Soviet troops lost about 6 thousand guns and mortars, more than 830 tanks. Personnel losses over the first two or three weeks of fighting accounted for about a million people, of which (according to the German data) 688 thousand soldiers were taken captive. The Soviet troops lost some 6000 guns and mortars, over 830 tanks. The enemy took the major part of the Smolensk, Kalinin and Orel regions
