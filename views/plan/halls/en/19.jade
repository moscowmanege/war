	div: i “Recollecting those days, I visualize our 16th army. Weakened by numerous losses, it clung to every inch of native soil, giving the enemy a severe rebuff, weakening its strength. Taking a step back, it was again ready to answer blows with blows, and was successful in doing this”

	p The first attempt of the German troops to capture Moscow in October was thwarted by the heroic efforts of the Soviet troops, supported by the working people of the whole country. The German military command set the task before the "Center" group of armies to destroy the Soviet troops in the close approaches to Moscow and at the same time encircle the capital. The task to envelop Moscow from the north was assigned to the 3rd and 4th tank group and part of the forces of the 9th Army (7 tank, 3 motorized and four infantry divisions), and from the south – to the 2nd tank army (4 tank, 3 motorized and 5 infantry divisions). The central armies of the Western Front were planned to be destroyed using the forces of the 4th German Army (18 infantry, 2 tank and 1 motorized Divisions) by delivering strikes north and south of the highway Moscow – Minsk and along the Warsaw highway to Podolsk. The flank armies of the German "Center" group of armies were assigned a task to ensure offensive on Moscow: the 9th Army, comprised of the 11 infantry divisions, by ensuring defense for the line Selizharovo, Kalinin, while the 2nd Army, consisting of 7 infantry divisions, one tank and one motorized divisions – by an offensive in the direction of Yelets and further east to the upper reaches of the Don river. In total for the capture of Moscow the German military command allocated 51 divisions, of which 13 tank and 7 motorized divisions. The remainder 20 divisions were used to cover the flank groupings of the troops.
	p Such were the conditions under which the second “general” offensive of the German troops on Moscow was launched. The highlights of the events in the Moscow direction in the period from November 15 to December 5, 1941 became Klin-Solnechnogorsk (16.11 – 12.05.1941) and Tula (18.11 – 12.05.1941) defensive operations. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the troops of the Western Front (commanded by the Army General, G.K. Zhukov) by the end of December 5 the offensive of the German troops in the western direction came to a halt. The main enemy attack forces failed to break through to Moscow.
	p Over the period of the defensive operation irretrievable losses of the Western, Reserve, Bryansk and South-western fronts amounted to more than 541,3 thousand. men. However, the second German offensive on Moscow was halted on all directions. Over 20 days of this offensive the enemy advanced 80-90 km to the north of Moscow and 110 km to the south of it. The German-fascist troops managed to come out to the Moscow – Volga channel in the area of Yakhroma, to cut across the Nara river north and south of Naro-Fominsk, and to approach Kashira from the south. The enemy, which completely exhausted its offensive capabilities, was forced to assume a defensive, without reaching the assigned goal.

	p The 316th rifle Division was formed in July – August 1941 in Almaty as part of the command of the 1073rd, 1075th and 1077th Infantry and the 857th Artillery Regiments. Commander of the division, Major General I.V. Panfilov, served as a military commissar of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. The backbone of the division was composed of the residents of the city of Alma-Ata, Nadezhdenskaya and Sofiyskaya villages, the city of Frunze. On August 18th the Division was loaded into trains and sent near Novgorod at command of the 52nd Reserve Army, which was planned to be formed. By September 8th the Division, by cutting across the river Ust-Wolma, arrived to Krestzy, where it took positions in the second echelon of the army and for almost a month had been organizing terrain of the defensive sector. On October 5th the Division was transferred under Moscow, where it was first made part of the 5th and then – the 16th Armies. From October 7 to October 12, it was unloaded in Volokolamsk and took a 41 km -long defense sector, which extended from an inhabited locality Lvovo to a collective farm Bolychevo. The division was reinforced by two artillery regiments and a tank company, and thus had a powerful artillery. On October 18 it was attached with the 1st Guards tank brigade urgently transferred from the vicinity of Mtsensk on Stalin's personal order. On October 27 the German troops broke through the defense of the neighboring 690th Infantry Regiment. The 316th rifle Division was forced to leave Volokolamsk and take up defensive positions east and south-east of the city at the line Maleevka – Chentsy – Big Nikolskoye – Teterino.
	p On November 16th the Division was attacked by the forces of one infantry and two tank divisions of the Wehrmacht. Positions of the 1075th Infantry Regiment in the area of Dubosekovo were attacked by the 11th tank division of the 46th motorized Corps of the Wehrmacht. The south of the positions at the joint with a Separate cavalry group of colonel L.M. Dovator, was attacked by the 252th Silesian Infantry Division, supported by a tank battalion of the 5th tank division. Panfilov’s units together with the tank crewmen of the 1st Guards tank brigade conducted heavy defensive battles against the superior forces of the enemy, in which personnel showed mass heroism. On this same day took place the events at the junction Dubosekovo, which were then described by the feature writer of the "Red Star" newspaper and remained in the mass consciousness as the "feat of 28 heroes of Panfilov division” (“Panfilovtsy”). On November 17 th the Division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. On November 18 the German tanks came out to the headquarters of the division in the village Gusenevo (Volokolamsk district, Moscow region.). As a result of the mortar shelling, fragments of a German mortar bomb killed Panfilov. On that same day the division was reorganized into the 8 th Guards Rifle Division, which later finished the war on the Courland peninsula as the 8 th Guards Rifle Rezhitskaya Order of Lenin Order of Suvorov Division, named after the Hero of Soviet Union, Major General I.V. Panfilov.
