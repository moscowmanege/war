At that moment it seemed to us that we were standing in the face of history and it imperiously commanded: do not bring to shame the glory of those who died a hero's death here, multiply their prowess with new exploits, stand to the death, but block the path of the enemy to Moscow”
	p: i From memoirs of commander of the 5th Army D.D. Lelyushenko

	p By October 10 the German troops advanced towards Moscow by 180 km, coming up to the Mozhaisk defense line. This line of defense of the Soviet troops extended for 230 km from north to south from the upper reaches of the Volga River, west of Volokolamsk and Mozhaisk, to the Oka river. By this time, fortification of Mozhaisk defense line had not yet been completed. In total, 170 km of tank ditches were built, 95 km of escarps, as well as 296 bunkers, 535 earth and timber bunkers – which accounted in terms of firing points for 40% of the planned quantity.
	p On this line of defense the command deployed four infantry divisions, ten military academies (including the Moscow Artillery military academy, named after L.B. Krasin, military-political academy, the academy named after the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, Podolsk Artillery and Infantry Schools), courses for junior lieutenants of artillery of the Bryansk Front, courses of junior medical staff, junior lieutenants, junior political instructors of the Western front, courses for junior lieutenants of the 3, 29, 30, 31, 33, 43, 49 and 50th armies, three reserve rifle regiments and five machine-gun battalions. In addition, the Supreme Command General Headquarters sent to the Mozhaisk defense line five newly formed machine-gun battalions, ten anti-tank artillery regiments, and seven tank brigades.
	p Despite the measures taken, Mozhaisk line of defense was still weak. Based on calculations, it had to be defended by 150 battalions. By the time of arrival of the enemy's forward units it was manned only by 45 battalions. The flanks and junction points of the Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets and Kaluga fortified sectors remained uncovered.
	p For ease of control, the troops of the Moscow reserve front from October 13 had been merged with the Western Front, commanded by General of the Army G.K. Zhukov. As a result, all units acting in the Moscow direction from the Volga water reservoir to Kaluga, were united under a single command. The troops acting on the main lines of operations were formed into: in the Volokolamsk direction – into the 16th Army (commanded by Lieutenant General K.K. Rokossovsky), in the Mozhaisk line – into the 5th Army (from October 14 commanded by Major General L.A. Govorov), in the direction of Maloyaroslavets – into the 43rd army (commanded by Major-General K.D. Golubev) and in the Kaluga direction – into the 49th army (commanded by Lieutenant General I.G. Zaharkin). The command of the 33rd Army (commanded by Lieutenant General M.G. Efremov) was transferred into the reserve of the front in the area of Naro-Fominsk.
	p As a result of undertaken measures, the troops of the 33rd and 43rd  armies on October 20- 21 halted the advance of the 57th  Motorized and 12th  Army Corps of the enemy on the Nara river, while the troops of the 49th  Army by  October 23 halted the advance of the enemy 13th  Army Corps on the western outskirts of Serpukhov, at Tarusa and Alexin.   The 32nd Infantry Division failed to withstand the attack of the enemy 40th  Motorized Corps and retreated to the intermediate line of defense near Mozhaisk. Reinforced by a mixed rifle regiment and a tank brigade, it for five days constrained the advance of Nazis at the held lines of defense. The 5th Army, while being involved in fierce fighting, abandoned Mozhaysk and retreated to the rear position of the defensive line. Having received as reinforcement two infantry divisions, the army by the end of October 26-27 stopped the advance of the enemy at the boundary to the west and south-west of Kubinka. The 16th Army showed a sturdy resistance, that is why the strike of the enemy 46th Motorized Corps had no success. Over the five days of fierce fighting the enemy managed to advance only by 10 – 12 km on the 10 km wide front. Under the attacks of the troops of the enemy Army Corps from the west and two motorized corps from the south the troops of the 16th Army on October 27 abandoned Volokolamsk.
	p The German troops entered the territory of the Moscow region and were at a distance of 100-110 km from Moscow in the Volokolamsk direction, and at 80 km distance in the Mozhaisk, Naro-Fominsk and Podolsk direction. However, their advance slowed down. The average daily rate of advance of the enemy fell from 30-40 km in the first decade of October, to 3-5 km in the second half of the month.

	p: i “In the forest, where the school was located, there was an endless whistle of shells and bombs dropped from Nazi planes… Sometimes you would crawl to a cadet and find that he was dead, and then in horror you would draw near to another one. And when you get to a dugout, where there were eight people - and see the killed there, and alive there were one or two, and such wounded”

	p In the beginning of October 1941, the German troops broke through the Mozhaisk defense line on the Roslavl-Yukhnov direction. On October 5, reports were received on successful offensive of the Hitlerite troops against the Western and Reserve fronts: Soviet pilots which flew over this territory discovered a column of enemy tanks and motorized infantry which stretched for 25 km and was moving in the direction of the city of Yukhnov. This news seemed incredible, and it was rechecked twice before being reported to the Chief of the General Staff. From Yukhnov to the Moscow ring road there remained 216 kilometers – a daily march for German tanks, which met no  resistance. It was required to immediately close off this sector of terrain, but there was no troops, capable to offer organized resistance to the advancing enemy group. It was required to act quickly. Without waiting for instructions, the Chief of Staff of the Moscow Military District, Major General I.S. Belov issued an order to raise on combat alert Podolsk infantry and artillery military schools and send them to the city of Maloyaroslavets and take Ilyinsky combat sector in the Mozhaisk line of defense.
	p The Podolsk infantry school was organized in January 1940 and was training junior command personnel for the positions in rifle and machine-gun platoons for the Army. Major-General Vasily A. Smirnov was appointed as the Chief of the School. In May and July 1941, the school made two early releases of lieutenants –platoon commanders. With the beginning of the war enrollment of cadets for the first year of training increased, but the training program was significantly reduced: subjects not related to military training were excluded.  As of October 1, there were 2101 cadets (1468 – first year and 633 – second year cadets). In terms of organizational structure, the school consisted of four cadet battalions comprised into four companies (120-150 men each). The 1 st and 3 rd battalions were manned with high school graduates, aged between 17 and 18 years, who managed to undergo only slightly more than a month’s training in the military school. The 2nd battalion consisted of cadets which were enrolled in May 1941, and had behind them a little more than 5 months of training. The 4 th Battalion was comprised of older students (from 22 to 30 years of age) who were sent to the military school from the field army or were conscripted by military commissariats.
	p Podolsk artillery school, organized in September 1938, had been training antitank artillery platoon commanders. In terms of organization the school consisted of four cadet battalions. Each training battalion consisted of three artillery batteries, and the batteries – of four training artillery platoons. Before the war, the school made two early releases of cadets which were immediately sent to the western military districts. As of October 1, there were 1500 cadets. The school had in service 42 guns of various calibers, which performed the function of training devices. They were immediately brought into combat state and were made fit for firing. The artillery school was commanded by an experienced gunner, Colonel Ivan Semenovich Strelbitsky, who had experience in the war with the German troops. As a commander of an artillery brigade on the western front, he participated in the frontier battle and the battle of Smolensk of June – August 1941.
	p On October 5 about 1500 cadets of the artillery school and 2,000 cadets of the infantry school were sent to the area of Maloyaroslavets. The combined detachment of cadets, commanded by V.A. Smirnov, by an order of the commander of the Moscow Military District N. 1, dated October 6 1941 was set the following task:
	p: i “…using Maloyaroslavets fortified area, comprised of Podolsk artillery school, Podolsk infantry school, reserve infantry regiment, battalion of the 33rd reserve brigade, two antitank artillery regiments, a howitzer artillery regiment and a tank company – to firmly cover the direction Medyn, Maloyaroslavets with a task of preventing a breakthrough of the enemy tanks and infantry in the direction of Maloyaroslavets…”
	p Within a few days the cadets warded off the offensive by repelling on October 11 the attack of many times superior enemy forces, and on October 13 – the attack from the rear. On October 16 German troops captured defense lines in the Ilyinsk combat sector. Almost all cadets who held the line in this sector died. On October 17 situation in the area of the village Ilyinskoe became critical. The German infantry and tanks incessantly attacked the defensive positions. On the night of October 17 to 18 the command of the military schools received a withdrawal order. Leaving a covering party, the thinned out defenders of Ilyinsk line moved to link up with the units of the 43rd Army, which was taking defensive positions along the Nara River. Surviving cadets of Podolsk military schools (270-500 out of 3500) were sent to Podolsk. After a small rest, together with the military schools they were relocated to continue their training. The Podolsk infantry school was sent to the city of Ivanovo, and the artillery school – to Bukhara in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.
	p 37 graduates of these schools for feats committed during the Great Patriotic War were granted a title the Hero of the Soviet Union.
	p During the fighting in the Ilyinsk combat sector Podolsk cadets together with the soldiers from other Red Army units destroyed up to 5 000 German soldiers and officers, and brew up some 100 tanks, blunting for two weeks the advance of the German units.
	p On May 8, 1975 in the village Ilyinskoye a Memorial Complex was opened, which included a Military-Historical Museum "Ilyinskye military lines" and a Mound of Glory with a monument to Podolsk cadets. In the village Kudinovo there is a mass grave of Podolsk cadets.
