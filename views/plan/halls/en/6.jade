	p The entire record of the Battle of Moscow convinces that the victory in the battle was achieved not just in the battle field but in the minds of people, in the realm of human spirit. Citizens were feeling it was their duty to go through the plague that had befallen them with dignity. Nobody could be done without in that fight: bill-posters, actors on stage, spectators crowding theater, movie and concert halls, museum attendants and librarians who continued to preserve cultural values for future generations. Libraries operated in the vestibules of some Metro stations, e.g., at the Kurskaya station. Proceeding in war environment with activities they customarily performed in peace time people sometimes were unaware that they were performing a feat.
	p Children are personification of the future at all times. They gave hope in the besieged city too. Children always remain children; even at that severe time when in between air alerts they would play in empty yards with their mates who also had not been evacuated, when at air raids they would go down into bomb shelters taking their favorite toy or book; when they would sleep at Metro stations or stand in long lines with food cards instead of mothers or elder brothers or sisters working two shifts at plants. Half-starving, they did not like to stay alone indoors, but gathering in flocks would fearlessly run through the streets of the city to see the shot-down German bomber publicly displayed in August 1941 or would dig potatoes which remained in the trial field in the vicinity of Kolkhoznaya Square. Waiting for letters from the front instead of which death notices often came they grew up early but many of them went to school later than their peace time age mates. In 1941 school classes were cancelled and many children who filled 8 (in those years that was the school age) would go right to the third form at the age of 10 or 11. And when classes resumed in school year 1942-43 it turned out that pass rate reached 92% because war children were very responsible about studies.
	p Before the war Moscow had 21 theaters which in 1940 catered for the audience of 5 249 000. But in August 1941 by the Government resolution the network of Moscow theaters was reduced to 12 companies. In October most of them were evacuated. As of 11 November Moscow had eight operating theaters: Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, Drama Theater, Militia Theater, Regional Comedy and Variety Theater, Regional Youth Theater, Regional Kolkhozny Theater, 1-st State Circus and Music Hall. In December in the days Nazis were being battered at Moscow the Drama Theater was opened to cater for general public and military units, by pooling actors of Lensovet Theater, MKhAT, Maly Theater, Revolution Theater, Chamber Theater and Leninsky Komsomol Theater. During the 1941-42 season Moscow also had in operation Bolshoi Theater Branch, Regional Youth Theater, sketch and review theaters.
	p Movie theaters were not evacuated. In the years of war the network of permanent Moscow movie theaters reduced from 38 to 33. Two of them (Mossovet and Sport) were destroyed in 1941. On 29 September, completely overhauled, the Khudozhestvenny Cinema opened. However the city completely scrapped the network of cinema vans (before 22 June 1941 the number of such vans was 20) and children’s theaters. From the very war start cinematographers began to create shorts distributed as cine-collections. But production of full-footage feature films never stopped. Historical pictures were very popular reminding that enemy had never been victorious in the Russian land.

	h3 Healthcare

	p In the state of war Moscow medical workers faced the challenge to ensure fail-proof operation of healthcare institutions aimed at returning to duty of wounded Red Army soldiers and officers and medical assistance to population injured in air raids of the city.
	p Since the first days of the war Moscow deployed a broad network of hospitals. Prepared for reception of the wounded were not just all medical institutions of the capital but also hundreds of maternity hospitals, nurseries, nursery schools of the city (as a result of evacuation east of Moscow during the first months of the war of children and maternity institutions). In total Moscow additionally deployed over 30 thousand beds. And at the end of 1941 the capital and the region had already over 200 hospitals.
	p Since the first days of the war experienced specialized physicians began to treat the wounded. Thus, 1st Moscow Communist Military Hospital under the helm of Chief Scientific Consultant Academician N. Burdenko rearranged its underground facilities for their reception turning then essentially into a complete underground hospital with operating and bandaging rooms, and deployed extensive effort as well related to formation of evacuation stations, hospitals, ambulance trains for medical support of Red Army units and formations. The Emergency Medicine Institute named after Professor Sklifosovsky turned in the first days of war into the Integrated Surgery Clinic headed by Professor Yudin. The Institute incidentally manufactured and sent to the frontline portable orthopedic apparatuses, drip phleboclysis systems, streptocide sprays and field laboratories. The donated blood procurement station created with the Institute daily sent to the front 150-180 liters of blood. Institute field brigades assisted front surgeons.
	p Back in the very first months of the war Moscow hospitals successfully applied the method of cerebrocranial wound surgery developed by Professor Bakulev. 1-st Moscow Medical Institute tested new methods of treatment in the area of military surgery and traumatology under the auspices of Academician N. Burdenko. In the City Clinical Hospital named after S.Botkin Professor A.Frumkin successfully made plastic surgery (while in the specially equipped underground operating room of the hospital most complex surgery was carried out).
	p Results of scientific research of Academicians Burdenko, Averbakh, Professor Yudin and others permitted to improve the methods of surgical treatment of soft tissues, bones and internals. New methods were developed for initial debridement, solid plaster bandage, nerve grafting in case of extensive breakdown. Combination treatment of wounds was implemented: bandaging, blood transfusion, physiotherapy, exercise therapy, etc.
	p The Central Blood Transfusion Institute, the Central Moscow City Blood Transfusion Station located in a building of the City Clinical Hospital named after S. Botkin as well as 27 donor centers set up early in the first weeks of the war in Moscow districts operated under big strain throughout the war. 342 thousand Moscovites donated over 500 thousand liters of blood to save lives of wounded soldiers.
	p 750 enterprises and institutions of the capital took hospitals under permanent patronage; Moscow medical workers were assisted by more than 200 thousand Moscow women in care for wounded warriors.
	p Medical aid to people wounded in air raids was rendered by units and divisions of capital medical sanitary service headed by D. Levant. Their activities helped regain working ability to 90% of Moscovites. Jointly with the Moscow Red Cross Committee (Chairman N. Belenkiy) the city ambulance service trained under the program “Ready for Sanitary Defense” over 60 thousand people during the first 6 months of the war only. Many of them became participants of service units and divisions.
	p City Ambulance Station created and supervised by its head physician A. Puchkov operated faultlessly. Service workers not just rendered urgent qualified medical aid to Moscow civil population (ambulance stations in separate city districts were transformed into mobile traumatological parties) but also on a routine basis transported large groups of wounded soldiers from the frontline to Moscow hospitals.
	p For selfless work during the Moscow defense period over 300 medical workers of the capital were decorated with high government awards, more than 30 got the title “Merited Physician of the Russian Federation”, hundreds were awarded badges “Expert of Healthcare”, “Honorable Blood Donor of the USSR”, Diplomas of the People’s Healthcare Commissariat of the USSR.

	h3 Frontline Brigades

	p In the very first days of war the Plenum of the Central Committee of Art Workers Trade Union addressed artists with a proposal to join in the great liberatory fight. The Presidium of the All-Russian Theater Society on July 3, 1941 resolved to start preparing a repertoire. The key themes in the repertoires of theaters and artistic brigades were unity and consolidation of people in the face of the enemy, heroism of warriors, patriotism, events and figures of national history.
	p To serve the army and the navy about 400 theater and concert and circus brigades were formed and 25 frontline theater companies created. In total during the years of the Great Patriotic War about four thousand frontline brigades were organized (over 700 in Moscow and more than 500 in Leningrad). Concerts and performances often took place in direct proximity to the frontline during reposes between combat activities. Essentially, frontline fighters got a sense of unbreakable, continuous link of their present way of life with peaceful life in all its obvious and not so obvious aspects which they had been forcefully separated with.
