	div: i “In the Battle of Moscow for the first time in the history of military art, an air defense operation was conducted in which major forces participated on both sides. The capital of the Soviet Union as distinct from capitals of some other states at war was securely protected against hits of Nazi aviation. Even in close proximity to the frontline it waged full-fledged life inspiring the Soviet people for combat and labor exploits”
	p: i From memoirs of Commander of the 1st Air Defense Corps D. Zhuravlyov

	p Air defense forces were created back in 1918 and organizationally completed in 1925. They actually protected Moscow against hits of Nazi aviation.
	p
		i “…Moscow – that name I will wipe out…”,
		span – Adolf Hitler repeatedly stressed in his speeches before the top military command of Nazi Germany.
		i “Fuhrer’s determination to level Moscow and Leningrad with ground is adamant…”
		span – General Galder, Chief of General Staff of German Army put down in his diary. Special role in the execution of these plans was allocated by German command to aviation. For air attack on the capital of the Soviet Union they created 2-nd air fleet under the command of Field Marshall General Kesselring, which included best bomber wings. Airplane crews had experience of bombing major European cities.
	p Kesselring’s air force aces were counteracted by the well-coordinated system of Moscow Air Defense Area under the command of Major General Gromadin, which included 1-st Air Defense Corps, 6-th Fighter Corps, Tula and Kalinin Air Force Brigade areas. Apart from fighter aviation they also put into operation anti-aircraft artillery regiments, antiaircraft machinegun regiments, floodlight regiments, air-barrage balloon regiments and aircraft observation, alert and communication regiments. The first massive raid on Moscow was undertaken by Nazi aviation on the night of 21-22 July 1941. Until then the enemy conducted ever growing close-in air reconnaissance. 22 bombers were shot down by Moscow Air Defense forces. That cost the city 7 destroyed enterprises, 27 houses, 60 fires, 138 people killed and 881 wounded. For successful rebuff of the first enemy air raid on Moscow the People’s Commissar of Defense commended in his order of July 22, 1941 the entire personnel of 1-st Air Defense Corps and 6-th Fighter Corps. And on the 23rd of July Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet decorated 11 most distinguished air defense fighters of the capital with high government awards: Orders of Lenin, Red Banner and Red Star. From July 22 almost nightly and somewhat later daily Nazi aviation raids started that lasted sometimes for 5 to 9 hours. Air defense fighters repelled the strike of the Nazi armada that attempted to break through to the city on the eve of November 6. The historic parade of Moscow Garrison forces in the Red Square on November 7 took place under clear skies…
	p Moscow air defense forces in the years of war successfully coped with their combat mission. Best Nazi bomber squadrons in clashes with Soviet fighters, anti-aircraft artillery and machineguns lost sometimes up to 50-70 percent of their personnel strength and were removed from combat duty. Barrage air balloons were continuously launched into the skies of the capital; enemy air aces were detected by radars and aircraft observation, alert and communication systems (VNOS) and illuminated with floodlights. Apart from defense of Moscow skies Moscow air defense aviation and artillery units also performed missions related to cover of battle orders and communications of Western Front forces, fighting with enemy infantry and tanks and storming of enemy airfields. Such augmentations became especially important as Soviet troops launched counteroffensive starting with early December and the number of enemy raids on the capital began to decrease gradually.
	p Moscow air defense forces destroyed 1305 enemy aircraft, 450 tanks, about 5 thousand automobiles, up to 50 thousand infantry personnel strength, plenty of other enemy technology and transport vehicles. For successful performance of combat missions and courage displayed many Moscow air defense units and formations were decorated with high awards and conferred honorary titles of guards. Pilots and artillerists, floodlight operators and VNOS fighters became chevaliers of numerous government awards, many of them were conferred a high title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
