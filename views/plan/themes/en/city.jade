	p For many centuries Moscow has been a heart of Russia. Time and again this city has been a principal objective of conquerors’ aggressive intentions. At the beginning of XVII century, in time of the Great turmoil, the future of entire country was shaped here in struggle with Polish invaders. The same occurred in 1812, when in the wake of the Borodino battle Napoleon entered Moscow; however 35 days later he had to leave the unconquered capital in haste hunted down by the Russian armed forces, losing his army and consequently his imperial crown. afterwards, 129 years later, Hitler had decided to seize Moscow taking account of his precursors blunders. But he also knocked hard against a “sentiment that has no name” as K. Simonov wrote in 1941 in his poem “Homeland”:
	p
		div: i “…Yes, you can survive in ardent heat or thunderstorm, or frosting,
		div: i You can be dying of hunger or cold,
		div: i You can face death… But those three birch trees
		div: i You won’t surrender them to anyone as long as you’re alive.”
	p …During that memorable year, against the background of alarming fears and gossips of a forthcoming war with Germany, the radio announcement on a treacherous attack of fascist was still unexpected, it divided sharply a peaceful life and war time. Stalin speaking in his radio address on July 3, 1941 said:
	p: i “It is of paramount importance that our people, the Soviet people, realize fully the abyss of menace that threatens our country, that they abandon the complacency, carelessness and peaceful activity disposition that was quite understandable in pre-war time, but that becomes destructive at the present time, when the war has changed the situation drastically.”
	p The news of the attack came to Moscow in the shortest summer night of June 22, when schools were holding graduation parties; and school graduates who only yesterday were making their plans for the future, next day were queuing at military recruiting offices urging their officials to get them enlisted and to be sent to the front line. A communiqué by General Headquarters of the Red Army issued on June 23, 1941 told of the first clashes with the enemy, it read:
	p: i “After some encounter attacks the enemy was beaten back with significant losses. Hostile aviation assailed some of our airfields and populated localities, but everywhere it was met with a smashing blow of our fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery inflicting sizable casualties to the enemy.”
	p Moscovites, like many inhabitants of the Soviet Union, were sure that the war would not last long. According to memoirs of Marshal G. Zhukov:
	p: i “each enemy’s blow will be met with our double or triple blow – such was a psychological orientation of the people which had strenuously been implanted by our top political and military leadership at that time. The Army, the people, the Party considered that we had had really everything that was needed to guarantee to the country the infliction of a triple blow against each potential blow of the enemy, but unfortunately our capabilities at the time were substantially lower.”
	p Summaries arriving from the seat of the war were becoming more disturbing with each passing day, there were death notices pouring, and Moscovites took hard the messages about first military setbacks of the Red Army.
	p Moscow, together with the rest of the country rearranged itself to a military way of life, the city made preparations for a defense. The streets became noticeably emptier, there were no newcomers usually unhurriedly strolling along the capital’s streets, business travelers who used to be perpetually hurrying somewhere disappeared. Motley clothing of Muscovites gave way to soldier's blouses, uniform overcoats and military tunics. Number of cars reduced. Along the roadway of streets marched detachments of the volunteers who joined the Territorial Army, as well as factory and office workers, students and scholars, engineers and artworkers. Over half a million of Muscovites: women, teen-agers, senior citizens, day and night, in the calm and under bombardment, constructed fortifications around the capital encircling Moscow with antitank trenches and rows of steel antitank hedgehog. Life at railroad stations did not ceased day and night: hundreds of echelons filled with people and factory equipment were leaving for Siberia and the Urals. Remaining enterprises rearranged their activity for providing the military needs producing bombs and artillery shells, land mines and incendiary bottles. Air-barrage balloons ascended high in the capital sky. Thousands of Muscovites, combatants of the anti-aircraft defense detachments were on duty on the roofs of the houses and enterprises, in the attics and outside, in the streets and squares. Tens of thousands of Muscovites had enrolled to become blood donors, many of them donated blood free of cost or hand over the cash they were paid for it to the defense foundation. Meanwhile Hitler made a promise for all to hear that he is going to personally review his troops in Moscow. Moreover, the exact date for it was appointed, namely 16 of October, later on the date of the review was moved to 25 of October. In a desperate attempt to get the city into vice from the north and from the south, the German troops failed to outflank Moscow at distant approaches. They wanted to clamp a ring around the recklessly resisting city at close approaches. A German information agency wrote early in December:
	p: i “German offensive for the Bolshevik capital has advanced that far already that you can view the Moscow inner city through a good binocular.”
	p Of the 11 railroad tracks that connected Moscow with other places of the country, the fascists had cut seven, however along the remaining railroad tracks day and night echelons went from the Urals, from Siberia, from Central Asia and from Far East bringing to Moscow troops and ammunition, weaponry and military equipment. In the city itself, plants and factories worked ceaselessly. Whereas the Red Army combatant at the front came into battle with tanks and set fire on them, guerillas operated in the enemy‘s rear derailing the adversary’s echelons with troops and weaponry equipment. The German military leadership was of the opinion that the Russians resisted out of last effort, and that the fate of the beleaguer city had been foredoomed. But on December 5, 1941, a counterattack of the Red Army troops near Moscow began. A counterblow of the Kalinin front storm troops was unexpected and decisive. The next day, when millions of people in Russia and all over the world once again drove to their radio sets trying to get the Soviet Union call sign, they heard a summary of the Soviet Information Bureau:
	p: i “on December 6, 1941 the troops of our Western front having unsinewed the enemy in the preceding actions, launched the offensive against its flanking groupings… The German troops are hastily leaving abandoning equipment and armour, and suffering huge casualties.”
	p Moscovites were sure of the victory and it has come!
