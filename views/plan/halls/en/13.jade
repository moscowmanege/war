	div: i “We end the perpetual movement of the Germans to the south and west of Europe and direct our eyes at the lands on the east. We terminate the colonial and trade policy and go over to the policy of conquest of new lands. And when we speak today about a new land in Europe, we can only think of Russia and the outskirts within its control”
	p: i From "Mein Kampf" by Adolf Hitler, 1925

	p On July 22 1940, following completion of the military campaign in France, the leadership of the Hitlerite Germany took a final decision to carry out an attack on the Soviet Union. Direct preparation for the war against the USSR lasted throughout the year. In this preparation one can single out two main stages.
	p At the first stage (end of June 1940 – mid February 1941) military and political decisions were taken in respect of aggression against USSR, its conception and activities for strategic planning of the war were developed, the armed forces and the economy of Germany were refocused, qualitative improvement of the armed forces was carried out, the existent military units were reorganized and new ones were formed, combat training of troops intended for the war against the  USSR was enhanced.
	p At the second stage (February – June 22 1941) the bulk strength of the ground troops and almost the entire Air Forces were transferred to the East. Part of the Navy was redeployed and attack forces were created for attack against the USSR. The issues of interaction of ground troops with the AIR FORCES and the NAVY as well as with the Allied armies of Finland, Romania and Hungary were worked out, control of the troops and communication were established, the problems of logistical support for troops were resolved. At the heart of the strategic concept of the war against the Soviet Union was an improved idea of waging crushing blistering operations (“blitzkrieg”) on a broad front and at a great depth. The main striking role in such operations, according to the German command, should have been played by the tank troops and aviation. The major strategic objective was the capture of Moscow – the capital of the Soviet Union.
	p Despite conclusion of non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939, the Soviet government new that sooner or later Hitler would attack the USSR. Preparation of the Soviet Union for repulsion of the fascist aggression in the prewar years was carried out in two directions. In the field of foreign policy it followed the line of strengthening of international relations of the USSR and attempts to ensure potential of collective security. In the field of internal policy it was expressed in an attempt to strengthen soviet public and state system, in the development of economic potential of the USSR, in the all-round consolidation of the army and navy, providing them with sufficient supply of new weapons and military equipment, creation from scratch of aviation, artillery, shipbuilding and tank industry. The main emphasis was placed on the accelerated construction and siting of new enterprises of the defense industry in the eastern regions of the country, considerably remote from the western borders. Ungrounded political repressions of the late 1930s resulted in large-scale losses in the military officers of the RKKA (the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army), which subsequently impacted in a negative way on the progress of combat operations in the initial period of war.
	p The change of the state borders of the USSR in the west over 1939-1940 made it necessary to rework the plans of protective mobilization, concentration and deployment of the armed forces against the possibility of war. This plan received the name “The Plan of the defense of the state border of 1941”. For each border military district (Leningrad, Baltic Special, Western Special, Kiev Special and Odessa Military District) the tasks were set, critical directions for cover were assigned, composition of forces allocated for protection of the state border was specified as well as other tasks were set including the plans for evacuation of plants, factories, banks and other commercial enterprises, government agencies, the military and state property.
	p By June 1-10 some 755 thousand of designated personnel were conscripted for reservist training, some other 38550 men were conscripted for manning of fortified areas of the western military districts. From June 15 the advance of troops from the internal military districts closer to the state border  has begun (22nd army of the Urals Military District, 21st army of the Volga Military District, 19th army of the North Caucasus Military District, 16th army of the Zabaikal'skii military district). The Soviet military command paid special attention to the protection of Moscow – the capital of the USSR, for which purpose antiaircraft defense of the city was enhanced.
