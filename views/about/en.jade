p An exhibition project “The Battle of Moscow. First victory” is devoted to one of the biggest battles in the history of world’s wars in terms of both the number of participants and the amount of military equipment and weaponry. However, the point is not only in the scale of military confrontation. In the history of our country, in the historic memory of Russians, the battle of Moscow occupies a special place not least because of the fact that in the autumn of 1941 the war spread out in the true sense of the word “at the gate Moscow”, the capital of USSR, a historic, economic, political and cultural center of the country formed over the course of history. on the eve of the invasion, in plans of the German military leadership (Directive No. 21 dated 18.12.1940, so called “Barbarossa’s Plan), the seizure of Moscow was assigned the role of “the decisive success” as to its political and to economic significance.  The enemy rushed to this success from our western frontiers taking advantage of the numeric overbalance of forces and of some strategic considerations that included the unexpectedness of attack and blitzkrieg thrust and advance of tank and truck-mounted formations rapidly moving deeply inland. Moscow had been a terminal objective of the offensive for the “Center” Army group, a most powerful formation of the three German invasion clusters. The Soviet troops failed to repel the aggression, which allowed the enemy to capture the strategic initiative straight away and keep hold of it for a long time. On the side of the Hitlerites were the military potential of the entire occupied Europe and the victorious background of conducting modern warfare. The Soviet western front had been completely defeated. The enemy swept towards the heart of the Soviet state, and with each step, with just one more military advance it appeared that the enemy was approaching its intended objective. Years later, Marshall of the Soviet Union G. K. Zhukov recalled those days filled with a sense of bitter defeat:
p: i “What the guilt of the top military leadership in preparing the country to defense and in training the armed forces to a war consisted of? it needs honestly to say that neither People's Commissar of Defense nor me possessed the experience required to prepare the armed forces to the war that spread out in 1941, and as it is well known, the experienced military specialists had been exterminated during 1937-1939 period. And the experience of warfare of such a scale, with such swing and under such incredibly complicated conditions had been accumulated by all of us later, on in the course of war”.
p thus the events of that “hot summer of 1941” turned out to become a tragic prologue to our victory in the battle of Moscow, without which it would be impossible to grasp and to evaluate neither our sacrifice nor our achievements. During those the most stressful days of our retreat the Soviet soldiers displayed unprecedented heroism and courage, they sacrificed their lives in order to seal a road to the enemy, allowing our military decision makers to gain time for planning new operations, for concentration of reserves pointed towards the most probable direction of the adversary‘s blow and for erection defensive facilities both at the approaches to the capital and in the city proper. General G. Blumentritt, chief of staff for the 4 Hitlerite army, one of the “Center” Army group, whose task was the seizure of Moscow, had to acknowledge:
p: i “…Behavior of the Russian troops, even during their first clashes with our forces showed a striking contrast to behavior of the Polish and western allies in defeat. as a matter of fact, even surrounded, the Russians stubbornly continue their last-ditch combat”. the contribution to this victory was brought in by the heroes of the Brest fortress, by those who fought to the bitter end defending Smolensk, and also by those who fought being surrounded in Vyazma entrapment, most of whom did not live to see the “dawn of victory”.
p G. K. Zhukov wrote:
p: i “showing my deep appreciation to all the participants in the battle of Moscow, who have survived, I bow my head to the cherished memory of those, who died in the last ditch but not let the enemy pass to the heart of our homeland, to its capital, the hero-city of Moscow. We all are in an irredeemable debt to them.”

p At the same time Moscow inhabitants “strengthened the home front”; they sacrificed everything in the name of victory. one of outstanding pre-war theorists of the Red Army, A. A.  Svechin claimed that a defeat in war (the same concerns a victory) is a direct result of a way of life of a country in peace-time. In that war we possessed indisputable moral ascendancy; our cause had been the right one; by contrast the ideological basis of our adversary was composed of the criminal doctrine of racial superiority of one nation over the other and of “necessity of strife for “Lebensraum”. The outcome of the battle of Moscow had displayed moral preparedness of the Soviet citizens to defend their homeland, cohesion between the front and the rearward, and solidarity of the nation. As Anna Akhmatova wrote in her well-known poem, created in the days of the Moscow battle:
p: i “Our clock have chimed the hour of courage,/And that courage will stay with us forever.”
p
	span Having overcome the fear of death, panic disposition, horror bombardments, privations of siege, the Muscovites responded to appeals of leadership of the country and of the city concerning mobilization: they enrolled in the ranks of the Territorial Army, joined voluntary fighter battalions and detachments of anti-aircraft defense, they suppressed fires, erected barriers  at the long-distance and the close approaches to the capital, used to work for two shifts in a row at plants and factories, stood on duty at military hospitals and gave back their personal savings and valuables to assist the front.
	i “the Moscowites scrupulously fulfilled their duty to homeland not only by their participation in the fight against the enemy in the battle fields, but also by their selfless work at the factories and plants”
	span – wrote Marshall of the Soviet Union A.M. Vasilevskiy.
p The victory near Moscow had affected the entire following progress of the war convincingly proving military efficiency of the Red Army and preparedness of the overwhelming majority of our people to rebuke the cruel and deadly enemy. The defenders of the city hold themselves firm in front of the powerful onslaught of fascist hordes, they brought the enemy to stop and repelled it from the walls of Moscow. and that was but the first crushing defeat to the Hitlerite troops in the second world war!.
