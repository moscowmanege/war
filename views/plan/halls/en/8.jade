	p Since mobilization plan was introduced on 23 June 1941 almost all enterprises switched to output of military products. First to be restructured were key industries – mechanical engineering and metalworking. They were supplied with equipment, raw materials, supplies and hands as first priority. Textile and light industries of Moscow transferred over 1200 units of equipment for manufacture of arms and ammunition. Major machine engineering, machine-tool and instrument-engineering plants got urgent and concrete front orders. Production of airplanes, tanks, various military outfits and equipment for defense industry was expanded. The cadres for that were to a big extent supplied by Moscow women – wives, mothers and sisters of their fighting men. They were the first in the nation to give out the call: “Women – to Production Sites!” thus laying the basis of a major patriotic move as wives started to master male occupations. Within the first five months of the war alone the Moscow industry received an influx of over 100 thousand women hands. Many pensioners also resumed their occupations at plants and factories along with old-time regular employees. At the same time production shops were beginning to get support of teenagers and undergraduates determined to the extent of their ability and knowledge to help production teams in performing war orders.
	p In July Moscow industrial enterprises started to be evacuated. Within a short time in great transport shortage, sometimes under bombardment, tens of thousands of machines, equipment items, material and raw material items were taken out of Moscow. Relocated as the first order were enterprises manufacturing warfare, arms and ammunition. Evacuated into the rear were roll-bearing plants, Motor Plant named after Stalin, Vladimir Ilyich Plant, Dynamo, Caliber, Kauchuk, Krasnyi Proletariy, Moskabel, etc. At the same time many enterprises of light, food and textile industries were evacuated. In October-November evacuated from Moscow and Moscow Region were 498 major industrial enterprises of Union and Union-Republican subordination. By the end of November of the 75 thousand machines available in Moscow 54 thousand were removed. Evacuated enterprises were joined by over 1.5 million qualified workers and servants, engineers, technologists and their families. On new locations the teams of Moscow enterprises shortly arranged output of products for the front. Following defeat of Nazi troops at Moscow reevacuation of many Moscow plants began and as early as in mid 1942 some of them started to output their products at their former locations.
