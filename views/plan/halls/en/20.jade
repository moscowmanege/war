	div: i “Seconds seemed to be days, years. I did not feel the cold any more. My eyes were directed frontwards. I was waiting. The steam train was already close – steam had been reaching us. I connected the wire. There was a thundering explosion. A big pillar of fire took to the air, lifting the train; the black car as if reluctantly fell down on the mound”
	p: i From the memoirs of partisan of the Volokolamsk district I.N. Cousin

	p In the second half of July 1941, the Moscow Regional Committee of the Party began to prepare the deployment of the guerrilla struggle in the event of an invasion of the enemy on the territory of the Moscow region. For this purpose, the district and city committees of the communist party selected some 1,800 people, 1223 of which were communists and 264 – Young Communist League members. There were 150 women among partisans. In total 41 partisan parties were created . 100 bases were established in the region suitable for life in winter conditions. Each base was procured with food, weapons, ammunition, clothing, footwear, medicines and other equipment. During the period of temporary occupation of areas of the Moscow region the partisans inflicted great damage to personnel and equipment of the enemy.
	p Besides partisan parties, during the period of the defense of Moscow, military intelligence units also operated in the rear of the German troops. Military unit 9903 (commanded by Major A.K. Sproģis) was organized under the Intelligence department of the Headquarters of the Western Front for fighting against fascist invaders behind their lines, organization of the partisan movement in the territory temporarily occupied by the enemy and conducting of sabotage and reconnaissance activities. In the most difficult and dangerous days of the autumn of 1941 a mass recruitment was carried out of volunteer young Komsomol league members from Moscow and Moscow region. Within two to three months about two thousand men were enrolled to the unit. For the period of the Battle of Moscow, the  military unit 9903 had trained and sent to the rear of the enemy about 50 combat teams and parties. By means of mines laid by combat teams and parties behind enemy lines, in ambushes and during raids on enemy facilities a large number of troops and military equipment was destroyed. Valuable intelligence data on the actions and intentions of the enemy were obtained.
