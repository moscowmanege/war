.data-title THE MOSCOW UNDERGROUND (METRO)

.data-description
	p	During the Great Patriotic War the Moscow Metro lived the same way as the capital did, i.e. according to the war laws. Many of its workers joined the ranks of the Red Army and the people’s volunteer army, rose in arms to defend Moscow, fought in Stalingrad, in the Kursk Salient, over the Dnieper River, and captured Berlin. The production workshops of the metropolitan railway started manufacturing military products – mines and grenades, as well as restoring military hardware damaged in the battle. The funds collected by the metro workers were used to build an armored train called “Moscow Metropoliten” which distinguished itself in the famous Kursk Salient battle.
	p	During the most severe wartime of Moscow when fascist aviation tried to annihilate the city the Moscow Metro served as a safe veil for its citizens and defenders.
	p	The issues of using the Moscow metro as a mass shelter for Moscow people were discussed and evaluated already in prewar years when the Local Air Defense System (LADS) started to be deployed. For that end designers of MetroGiproTrans and specialists of Metrostroy made a great deal before the outbreak of war. But a great lot of things had to be done quickly within tight time limits of the war.
	p	The Moscow Metro worked according to a particular mode: at daytime it carried passengers, but in the evening it served as a safe shelter. As soon as the air raid alert sounded, the trains stopped running, they were halted at the nearest stations, the voltage was taken off, and all travelling stairs were running only in one direction – downwards. The volunteer fighters of metropolitan LADS detachments installed wooden gangplanks onto the running rails from the platforms and closed down all the openings through which shock waves could penetrate. Wooden boards were also installed over the rails in the metro tunnels. The work was done very accurately and quickly; the stations and tunnels were ready to receive people after 2-3 minutes.
	p	The metro stations were well lighted; air from special filter-ventilation chambers freely circulated in all sections; the water was taken from drinking water fountains installed on platforms, and in tunnels it was taken from ordinary points of water supply. Catering and medical healthcare services were organized. Stationary first-aid posts were available at each station.
	p	Here propaganda centers were also operated; press releases of the Sovinformburo (Soviet Information Bureau) and TASS posters were regularly exhibited; cinema shows and concert group performances as well as various exhibitions were organized; travelling libraries offered their services; newspapers, magazines and books were sold. For children, art classes, artistic modeling, embroidery lessons and so on were working. In a word, the LADS fighters of Moscow Metro did their best to ensure Muscovites a full-scale protection and rest.
	p	At Kirovskaya station (now “Chistiye Prudy”) as one of the deepest stations at that time, there was located the Air Defense Headquarters of Moscow. During the first months of the war, during German bombardments, the General Headquarters and personally J. Stalin moved from the Kremlin to this station. The trains passed this station without stopping; plywood fencing was erected along the route so that it was impossible to see what happens on the platform. The entrance to the station was closed and constantly protected. At “Kurskaya” station there was operating a branch of the State Public Library named after V.I. Lenin.
	p	The Muscovites will never forget the date of November 6, 1941. Metro station “Mayakovskaya”. Ceremonial meeting of MosSoviet dedicated to the 24th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. Speech of the MosSoviet Chairperson V.P. Pronin. Report of the Head of the Soviet State J. Stalin. Concert with participation of the Bolshoi Theater stars. Live broadcasting of the event by all radio stations of the country with Yuri Levitan, the famous All-Soviet Union Radio news-caster, on the air, and clear free sky above the city – the Air Defense warriors allowed not a single enemy war plane to the capital.

		i “Built in the days of the Great Patriotic War”
		span such words are inscribed in gold letters on marble in the vestibules and underground halls of 7 stations of Arbat-Pokrovskaya and Gorky-Zamoskvoretskaya lines of Moscow Metro.
	p Always not so easy, the work of the Metro builders was made more difficult during the war years. For instance, some parts of escalators which were manufactured in Leningrad (cut off by fascists from the rest of the country in September 1941) and mounted on site within several months now had to be produced in Moscow by local enterprises (“Serp i Molot”, Ordzhonikidze plant, 1st and 2nd state ball bearing plants, and others).
	p The great and heroic deeds of the Soviet people during the awesome years of war are depicted in the décor and ornamentation of each station of that line. Decoration of “Semenovskaya” station is fully dedicated to the heroic warriors of the Soviet Armed Forces (sculptors V. Mukhina, N. Ventcel, architect S. Kravets, painter B. Akhmetyev). Partisan activities during the war is the theme of ornamentation of “Izmailovsky Park” station (architect B. Vilensky, sculptor M. Manizer, painter А. Goncharov). The labor feat of Soviet people is the gist of décor at “Electrozavodskaya” station (architects V. Gelfreich, I. Rozhin). The unity of front and rear is at the core of the interior design of stations “Avtozavodskaya” (architect А. Dushkin), “Baumanskaya” (architects B. Iofan, Yu. Zenkevich, sculptor V. Andreev), “Novokuznetskaya” (architects I. Taranov, N. Bykova, sculptors N. Tomsky, А. Zelinsky, S. Rabinovich, N. Shtamm, painters А. Deineka, V. Frolov), “Paveletskaya” (architects S. Lyashchenko, Е. Demchenko). The grand sculpture composition “Metro Builders” is emplaced as a monument on the right side of the entry to the surface pavilion of “Electrozavodskaya” station.
