	div: i “We received an order of Stalin: to retard the German offensive at all costs by at least 5-7 days. And we had no idea with what to do this… On the way of Germans we could commit only the same Podolsk cadets and my aircraft, which attacked the advancing German troops several times a day”
	p: i From the memoirs of commander of the air forces of the Moscow Military District N.A. Sbytov.

	p Early in the morning on October 5, aerial reconnaissance of the AIR FORCES of the Moscow Military District detected tank and motorized divisions of the enemy which broke through and were advancing in the direction of Yukhnov. The Council of the Military District took a decision to destroy the fascist columns using all available forces. All aviation was thrown for performance of this task. At the direction of the General Headquarters, on the basis of the AIR FORCES of the Moscow Military District an air group was set up under the command of Colonel N.A. Sbytov. The air group acted on the Mozhaisk defense line of the Western Front. On October 8-19 the group made 508 sorties. As a result, a few enemy tanks and hundreds of trucks were knocked out of action, 3 ammunition depots were blown up, five bridges and crossings destroyed and up to two infantry battalions were scattered and also destroyed. The air group of Sbytov provided support to the troops of the 5 th Army, especially during their deployment. Pilots were flying in adverse weather conditions and often at heights of only 100-150 m with horizontal visibility of 600-800 m. In order to reduce the operational range and increase the number of sorties, as well as not to complicate the work of the air defense system for identification of flying aircraft, the night crews of Sbytov group relocated to the field airdrome, which allowed to increase the intensity of combat operations at night.
