	p At dawn (3:15 a.m. Moscow time) on June 22, 1941, tens of thousands of German guns rained down their fire on the border posts, field and permanent fortifications and locations of Soviet troops. At the same time enemy aircraft forces invaded the airspace of the USSR and subjected to an intense bombardment the cities of the Baltic republics, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and the Crimea, as well as airfields, naval bases, railway junctions and other military facilities in the western border districts. The total depth of impact of the enemy aviation on June 22 reached some 300-400 km.
	p The offensive, launched by the powerful attack forces of the German army turned out to be unexpected for our border military districts. They were unable to engage in the battle in an orderly manner. The depth of the advance of the enemy tank forces within the area of responsibility of the Western front, which covered the Brest-Minsk-Moscow direction, on the first day accounted for 35-60 km. By the evening of June 29th divisions of the 3rd and 2nd Panzer Groups closed the ring around Minsk. On July 3, on the 12th day of the war, chief of the general staff of the ground troops of Hitlerite Germany, Colonel-General F. Halder would write in his diary:
	p: i “In general, by now we can say that the task of crushing the main forces of the Russian land army before the Western Dvina and Dnepr has been accomplished…”
	p By July 10 out of the 44 divisions which made part of the Western Front - 24 were completely destroyed, 20 others have lost from 30 to 90% of military equipment and personnel. 32 warehouses with fuel out of 45 were destroyed and all warehouses with ammunition. The front of the fight along Minsk-Smolensk direction moved from our western borders within 350–600 km. The enemy took almost all of Belarus. The rate of advance of the German troops amounted to 25-35 km/day. This posed a certain threat to Moscow.

	p The Battle of Smolensk of 1941 has come down in history of the Great Patriotic War as the most important stage of disruption of the German plan of the lightning war. It lasted for more than 60 days and nights. The battle involved the armies of the West (commanded by Marshal of the Soviet Union S.K. Timoshenko), Central (commanded by Lieutenant General M.G. Efremov), Bryansk (commanded by Lieutenant General A.I. Eremenko) and Reserve fronts (commanded by General of the Army G.K. Zhukov). Their actions were a major strategic operation carried out in order to prevent the breakthrough of German troops to Moscow. The battle unfolded in the vast territory, up to 650 km in width and up to 250 km in depth.
	p The Battle of Smolensk began under conditions extremely unfavorable for the Soviet troops. By early July, as a result of the defeat of the armies of the Western Front in the border battle in Belarus, mobile forces of the "Center" group of armies came to the boundary of the midstream of the Western Dvina and Dnepr rivers. The troops of the Western Front, except for the 21st army were forced to retreat. A right-flank 22nd Army was split into two parts, its divisions were forced to fight being surrounded. Persistent fighting went on until the end of July. Divisions of the 19, 20 and 16 th Armies were surrounded in the vast area to the west, north and east of Smolensk, and were forced to retreat to the north-west of Smolensk. The troops of the 16 th Army by July 15 were conducting a fight for Smolensk. On July 21 – August 7, the Soviet military command made an attempt to organize and carry out a counter-offensive on the Smolensk-Moscow strategic direction. On a number of sections of the frontline the enemy was stopped. Now, before moving to the offensive on Moscow, the German military command was forced to secure its flanks and replenish its tank groups.
	p During the battle of Smolensk the Soviet troops in the western sector have been additionally supplemented with commands of the Central, Reserve and Bryansk fronts, 9 army commands, 59 divisions, two brigades and 275 thousand men of reinforcements. On September 10 the Soviet Armies assumed a defensive, completing a huge in scale and tension the two-month Battle of Smolensk. The enemy finally occupied Belarus, took the western territories of Smolensk, Orel and Kalinin Regions. The most important result of the two-month intense struggle became a disruption of the plan of the German command of nonstop advance on Moscow and preparation of the capital for the defense.
