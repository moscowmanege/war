	div: i “…You have to duly appreciate the German army which we had to meet face to face. Those were not potato-heads we have been losing ground to every thousand kilometers. That was the strongest army worldwide. To put it straight: the German army was better prepared, trained, armed, psychologically ready for the start of war, better involved into war than our army. We also have to admit that the German general staff and the German headquarters in general did their job better back then than our General Staff and our headquarters in general. German commanders were thinking better and deeper in those days than our commanders. We were learning throughout the war, and we did learn, and we started to hammer the Germans, but this was a lengthy process. And at the beginning of this process the Germans had the upper hand all the way through…”
	p: i G. Zhukov. From unpublished manuscripts.

	p A significant factor of the Victory of the Soviet people was the ability of the strategic leadership, the front and army commanders, commanders at all levels to direct troops and to achieve success in military operations.
	p In pre-war years, the Red Army was believed to be able to smash up an enemy and to drive in for the kill. This conviction reflected in the Draft Field Service Regulations, 1939, which said “…we will wage an offensive war and carry the war into the enemy's country. The Red Army will carry out annihilation military operations to overthrow the enemy and to secure an overwhelming victory hardly shedding any blood…”
	p Nevertheless, since the first days of the war, an extremely difficult situation unfolded in the lines. Due to mistakes and miscalculation of military activities made in force development and in determining the outset date of hostilities, band-aid solutions made to put the Army and the Navy on a high alert status, the Red Army could then be found underprepared for the attack. In addition, the losses of commanders told on it all because of Stalinist purges.
	p Young and educated officers capable of carrying out military tasks in challenging wartime conditions. Nevertheless, in spite of their military schooling and army service experience, they did not know theory and practice of waging modern warfare and direction troops during aggressive military action using masses of then modern means of armed fight. The Soviet military science had been crushed, while many outstanding military strategists like Svechin, Isserson and others had been ostracized or arrested.
	p Our military forces had been injured badly through the ill-founded purges of the army and navy command staff.
	p By January 1, 1941, many newcomers lacking adequate experiences as commanders and morale officers while occupying those positions had taken over command of military districts, army’s corps, divisions and regiments.
	p All this, along with other reasons, could not but tell on the leadership of the combat operations conducted by our forces in 1941–1942.
	p The war that broke out selected the best commanding officers capable of directing troops. Those who stood fire in the Battle of Moscow and showed their worth in the critical lines around Moscow later commanded successfully fronts and armies in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Caucasus, the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of Dnieper, during the liberation operations in Ukraine, in Byelorussia and in the Baltics. Those were the forces of Zhukov, Rokossovsky, Konev, Eremenko and others, that liberated the European capitals and drew a line under World War II in Europe. Some of the defenders of Moscow ended World War II on the Pacific coast.
	p Front and army commanders, who took part in the Battle of Moscow, were battle-experienced (WWI, Civil War, Soviet-Finnish War, Khalkhyn Gol,  campaigns in West Ukraine and West Byelorussia), as they had participated in almost all wars and armed conflicts in the first half of the 20th century.
	p All of them had to soldier all over again around Moscow amid a modern warfare.
	p These were young commanders, 44 on the average, well-educated and picking things up. G. Zakharov, P. Kurochkin, L. Govorov, K. Golubev and M. Ivanov had higher strategic military education, as they had graduated short of war from not only the Frunze Military Academy, but the Military Academy of the Red Army General Staff as well. Many army commanders had graduated from the Frunze Military Academy, many of them had been attending various generalship advanced courses.
	p V. Kuznetsov, P. Sobennikov, K. Golubev, M. Lukin, A. Eremenko, F. Kostenko used to have commanded armies away back in the pre-war period. S. Timoshenko and G. Zhukov led the People's Commissariat of Defense of the USSR (the People's Commissar and the Chief of the General Staff); S. Budyonny was Deputy People's Commissar of Defense.
	p I. Konev, M. Popov, Y. Cherevichenko, P. Kurochkin, F. Ershakov and F. Kuznetsov had commanded short of war the North Caucasus Military District, the Leningrad Military District, the Odessa Military District, the Orel Military District, the Ural Military District and the Baltic Special Military District.
	p M. Purkayev and I. Boldin were deputy commanders of military districts.
	p G. Zhukov (twice), S. Timoshenko, K. Rokossovsky, I. Konev and L. Govorov were Knights of the Victory Order. Of all army commanders, K. Rokossovsky, L. Govorov, F. Golikov, I. Maslennikov, M. Popov, M. Purkayev, G. Zakharov, M. Efremov commanded fronts as well.
	p The most remarkable figure in the Battle of Moscow having a battlemaster and a look-ahead talent was certainly Marshal Georgievich Zhukov. Remembering his activities during the Great Patriotic War, Marshal A.M. Vasilevsky wrote in his memoirs “Life’s Work”: “…I think, I will not get it wrong if I say that G. Zhukov was the most striking personality among the warlords during the Great Patriotic War. Zhukov’s splendid talent was coming in full force more and more distinctly from year to year. Zhukov never looked like a warlord ranking above the soldiery. When planning an operation, he was best connected not only to army and division commanders, but to troop officers as well, especially to those employed on the main axis. And he therefore was deeply aware of the overriding sentiment among subordinates, could handle the unit and mastermind soldiers’ efforts to carrying the day…» (Moscow. 1988. Vol.2. P.278).
